## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

The initial version of this project was built using vanilla JavaScript. I enjoyed the process and outcome so much that I decided to upgrade the project using React. I also took the opportunity to apply some newly aquired CSS skills to the design and ensure I was using semantic HTML markup and accessibility best practices.

Here, you can view the [Deployed Version](https://aeposten.github.io/color-scheme-generator/) and [Github Repository](https://github.com/aeposten/color-scheme-generator) for the first version of this project, and below is a screenshot comparing both versions.
